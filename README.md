## What's It About?
We are building a basic, retro-inspired game that will expand on the Frogger game by adding additional twist mechanics for our game dev course COSC 416.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Frogger
- WASD Movement
- Moving platforms the player must jump across to reach the end
- Some platforms may dip under the water, adding a layer of difficulty for the player

### Expansion Mechanics
- LShift to block / parry
- Score increments for every frog you get to the end
- Game speeds up as you get more frogs to the end; This will cap at a certain speed
- Projectiles rain down from on top of you, adding an additional block / dodge / parry mechanic
- Parrying will provide some sort of bonus (not yet decided)

### Out of Scope (possibly add if time)
- A shop and currency system that will allow you to purchase enhancements like slowing platforms, slowing projectiles, increased parry timings, etc.
